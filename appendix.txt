Appendix - Example Scenario Templates
Understanding the Scenario Templates(in the Appendix)
The provided JSON templates (see Appendix) define the specific game world. Here's a quick breakdown of their structure:
attributes: These are the core statistics or characteristics that define your character's capabilities within that scenario (e.g., "Academic Pressure" or "Spin").
baseSkills: These are specific actions tied to attributes, representing what your character can attempt to do (e.g., "Grade Negotiation" or "Tantrum Management").
playerCustomizations: These are choices you make at the beginning of the game, like selecting a role or background. These choices often grant bonuses to specific attributes.
The typical flow should begin with the player choosing their playerCustomizations. Then, based on the template's design, the player might allocate a limited pool of points to their attributes, which in turn shapes their effectiveness with related baseSkills.
