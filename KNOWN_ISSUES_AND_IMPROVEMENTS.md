# Known Issues and Future Improvements

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication Flow Edge Cases**
   - Handling of expired sessions could be improved
   - Error messaging during authentication could be more descriptive

2. **Game State Management**
   - Long game sessions may lead to large context windows for AI
   - Potential for state inconsistencies if multiple tabs are open

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Some UI elements may need further optimization for smaller screens
   - Text input area could be improved on mobile devices

4. **Performance**
   - Large game histories may impact loading times
   - AI response times may vary depending on OpenAI API latency

## Future Improvements

### High Priority

1. **Offline Mode Support**
   - Implement caching and local storage for offline gameplay
   - Sync changes when connection is reestablished

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add more robust error boundaries
   - Implement retry mechanisms for API failures
   - Improve user feedback during errors

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement pagination for game history
   - Add lazy loading for components
   - Optimize database queries

### Medium Priority

1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add keyboard navigation support
   - Implement screen reader compatibility
   - Add high contrast mode

2. **Advanced Game Features**
   - Implement inventory system
   - Add NPCs with memory and relationships
   - Create quest/mission tracking
   - Add character progression and leveling

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Add animations for dice rolls and actions
   - Implement themes and customization options
   - Add game sound effects and music

### Low Priority

1. **Social Features**
   - Share game stories with other players
   - Create community challenges
   - Add friend system

2. **Analytics and Metrics**
   - Track user engagement
   - Analyze popular game scenarios
   - Gather feedback on AI responses

3. **Content Expansion**
   - Add more scenario templates
   - Create pre-built character archetypes
   - Add world-building elements

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Extract common functionality into hooks
   - Improve component modularity
   - Standardize error handling

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Implement integration tests for game flows
   - Add end-to-end testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed code comments
   - Create API documentation
   - Document database schema and relationships
